Files to Include: If you want to limit your search to a specific directory, you can specify the directory path in the “Files to include” field. 
For example, if you want to search only within the src directory, you would enter src/ in this field.

Files to Exclude: You can also exclude certain files or directories from your search by using the “Files to exclude” field. 
This is useful if you want to ignore certain file types or directories. 
You can use patterns like **/node_modules/* to exclude all files within node_modules directories.
Match Case: Click on the Aa button if you want your search to be case-sensitive.
Match Whole Word: Click on the ab| button if you want to match only whole words.
Use Regular Expression: Click on the .* button if you want to use regular expressions in your search.

The Search panel will display a list of files containing the search term, along with the number of matches in each file. 
You can click on any result to open the file and navigate directly to the occurrence of the search term.
You can navigate through occurrences within a file using the arrow buttons in the Search panel or by using the F4 (next) and Shift + F4 (previous) shortcuts.
