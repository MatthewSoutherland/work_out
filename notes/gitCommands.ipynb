    "Merge:\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge is used to combine the changes from one branch into another. It doesn't have to be just the main branch.  \n",

    "the history of both branches is preserved. This results in a new \"merge commit\" on the main branch,  \n",

    "It's commonly used on feature branches before merging them into the main branch.  \n",
    "When you rebase a branch onto the main branch, you're changing the base of your feature-branch to be the  \n",

    "Rebase rewrites the commit history by creating new commits for each original commit in the feature branch.  \n",

    "### BEST PRACTICES FOR USING GIT  \n",
    "1. <b>Update your local main branch:</b>  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Start by updating your local main branch to ensure it's synchronized with the remote repository. This involves:  \n",
    "<span style=\"color:yellow\">git checkout main</span>  \n",
    "<span style=\"color:yellow\">git pull origin main</span>  \n",
    "This ensures your main branch has the latest changes from the remote main branch.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. <b>Create and switch to a new branch:</b>  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Create a new branch for your feature or task and switch to it:   \n",
    "<span style=\"color:yellow\">git checkout -b branch_name</span>  \n",
    "This isolates your work from the main branch until it's ready to be shared.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. <b>Do your work:</b>  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Make your changes, commit them to your branch:  \n",
    "<span style=\"color:yellow\">git add .</span>  \n",
    "<span style=\"color:yellow\">git commit -m \"Your commit message\"</span>  \n",
    "Repeat this step as needed while you work on your task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. <b>Incorporate changes from main (if necessary):</b>  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Before integrating your changes into main, it's good to ensure your feature branch is up to date with the latest main branch changes.  \n",
    "This can be done in two ways:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* MERGE  \n",
    "<span style=\"color:yellow\">git checkout branch_name</span>  \n",
    "<span style=\"color:yellow\">git merge main</span>  \n",
    "This will bring changes from the main into your feature branch. Resolve any conflicts if they arise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Rebase (preferred for a cleaner history):  \n",
    "<span style=\"color:yellow\">git checkout branch_name</span>  \n",
    "<span style=\"color:yellow\">git rebase main</span>  \n",
    "This moves your branch's changes on top of the main branch's latest changes. Resolve any conflicts and continue the rebase process.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "5. <b>Test your changes:</b>  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Ensure that your code works correctly with the latest changes from main, especially if you've just merged or rebased.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. <b>Push your branch:</b>  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Push your feature branch to the remote repository:  \n",
    "<span style=\"color:yellow\">git push origin branch_name</span>  \n",
    "  \n",
    "7. <b>Create a Pull Request (PR):</b>  \n",
    "  \n",
    "On the GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or whichever service you're using, create a new pull request from your feature branch to the main branch.  \n",
    "Request a code review from your project collaborator.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "8. <b>Review, Merge and Clean up:</b>  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Once the PR is reviewed and approved, merge it into the main branch.  \n",
    "After merging, it's safe to delete your feature branch, both locally and remotely, to keep your repository tidy.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "9. <b>Update your local main branch again:</b>  \n",
    "  \n",
    "After the merge, make sure your local main branch is updated:  \n",
    "<span style=\"color:yellow\">git checkout main</span>  \n",
    "<span style=\"color:yellow\">git pull origin main</span>  \n",
    "By following these steps, you ensure that your feature branch is always up to date with the main branch,  \n",
    "minimizing merge conflicts. Additionally, you maintain a clean and linear project history by handling merges through pull requests.  \n",
