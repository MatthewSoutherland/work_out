Tooling feeds, speeds, depth cuts:
    Material
    tool diameter / HOH
        5:1 -> primarly milling
    tool design
        z_carb -> channel
        HEM -> 5% overlap -> radial chip thinning
        specific to Material
    inserted tool = .01 per tooth
        saw cutter = .005 per tooth
        facemills
            feedmill -> ridged workholding, shitty Material
            standard -> roughing -> button cutter
